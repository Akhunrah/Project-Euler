# Project-Euler

This repository contains the code I've written for the Project Euler problems I have solved so far.

I have used Python for each of these problems, and made a separate Python file for each problem, with the naming convention "ProblemAAA.py" where "AAA" is a number between 1 and 999, with preceding zeroes where necessary. Examples: "Problem007.py", "Problem034.py". Any data files needed for the problem follow the same naming convention, but with the file extension ".dat" instead.

Each file is strictly code. I have not included a description of the problem. Descriptions for the n-th problem can be found at "https://projecteuler.net/problem=n". Simply replace n with the number of the problem you want to see. Note that no preceding zeroes are used in n.

I trust I don't need to explain how to run it, but the easiest way is to open it in the Python IDLE and press F5.
